# MNIST_DenseNet
The code performs the image classification on MNIST dataset using DenseNet Architecture.

A slight penalty has been added in the loss function considering the area of the spread of the sample point much like center loss but is used only as penalty and is not optimized.

This is a quick and dry implementation, hence please check the code once before running it on your system for formal processes.
Any relevant pull/push request is appreciated.
